#  Data Analytics Portfolio    

This repository showcases my journey in practicing **data management, visualization, modeling, data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis** using **Python**, alongside my capstone-style **Google Data Analytics case study** (with Google Sheets, SQL, and R).  

Most projects here are exploratory and practice based.

- ![Machine Learning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Machine%20Learning-Models-F7931E?logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white) — Classification, Clustering, Neural Networks  
- ![Data Cleaning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Data%20Cleaning-Preprocessing-11557C?logo=databricks&logoColor=white) — One-Hot Encoding, feature selection, handling missing data  
- ![Google Sheets](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Sheets-Reporting-34A853?logo=googlesheets&logoColor=white) — Dashboards and case study reporting  
- ![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-Queries-4479A1?logo=sqlite&logoColor=white) — Extracting, filtering, and aggregating data  
- ![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-Data%20Analysis-276DC3?logo=r&logoColor=white) — Exploratory data analysis and reporting  



## **Repository Structure**  

### Association Analysis Project  
- **Goal:** Discover frequent itemsets and association rules in retail data.  
- **Techniques:** Apriori algorithm, One-Hot Encoding, Support & Confidence analysis.  
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, mlxtend, Matplotlib.  
- **Output:** Scatterplots of support vs confidence and interpretable association rules.  

### Classification Models Project  
- **Datasets:** `Churn_Modelling.csv` (customer exits) and `titanic_trains` (titanic dataset).  
- **Techniques:** Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN).  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Compared multiple models on classification accuracy.  
  - Found *ANN* and *SVM* to perform best.  
  - Used confusion matrices, cross-validation, and feature selection.  
- **Collaboration:** Built with *Marilyn Sarabia Ortiz & Isabel Santoyo-Garcia*.  

### Clustering & Text Mining Project  
- **Dataset:** `imdb_dataset.csv`.  
- **Techniques:**  
  - <u>Clustering:</u> K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN.  
  - <u>ANN & Classification Models:</u> Compared ANN with Logistic Regression & Decision Trees.  
  - <u>Text Mining:</u> CountVectorizer, TF-IDF Vectorizer.  
- **Outcome:** Identified clusters of movies, experimented with ANN and classifiers for predicting audience ratings, and explored text mining approaches.  
- **Collaboration:** Built with *Marilyn Sarabia Ortiz & Isabel Santoyo-Garcia*.  

###  Data Preprocessing Practice
- A collection of notebooks focused on *data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing data for analysis or modeling*.  
- Serves as a foundation for all other projects.  

### Comprehensive Analytics Presentation (CSC177 Final)  
- **Goal:** Summarize and present all techniques learned throughout CSC177.  
- **Content Covered:**  
  - Data Preprocessing Project  
  - Classification Models Project  
  - Clustering, ANN, and Text Mining Project  
  - Linear Regression Project  
  - Additional analysis techniques and findings  
- **Format:** Google Slides presentation consolidating results, insights, and comparisons across all projects.  
- **Collaboration:** Built with *Marilyn Sarabia Ortiz & Isabel Santoyo-Garcia*.  

###  Google Data Analytics Case Study  
- Focused on **business-style analytics and reporting**.  
- Tools: *Google Sheets, SQL, R*.  
- Includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and final reporting aligned with the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** format.
